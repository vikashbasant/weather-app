- RESTful API

## Getting Started
To get started with the Weather App project, follow the steps below:

## Prerequisites

Before setting up and running the Weather App project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** The project is built using Java, so you need to have JDK installed. You can download the latest JDK version from the official Oracle or OpenJDK website.

- **API Key from Weather API Provider:** The Weather App fetches weather data from a weather API. Before running the project, you need to obtain an API key from a weather API provider like OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI. Follow the API provider's documentation to get your API key.

- **Environment Variables (Optional):** If you prefer to use environment variables for the API key and API base URL, you should have a way to set environment variables on your operating system or development environment.

Note: The Java versions used during development are specified in the project's `pom.xml` files, respectively. Ensure that you have compatible versions installed.


### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
```

2. Set up the API key:

   - Obtain an API key from a weather API provider (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI).
   - Export the API key as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export WEATHER_API_KEY=your_weather_api_key_here
   ```

   Optionally, you can set the API base URL as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export WEATHER_API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com
    ```
Alternatively, you can set these environment variables in your preferred way for your development environment.

3. Build and run the Spring Boot backend:
```bash
 cd weather-app
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```


## Usage

1. Enter the location (e.g., city name) for which you want to check the weather in the input field.
2. Get Request: http://localhost:8080/weather?location="Enter City Name".
3. The weather data (temperature, humidity, and weather condition) for the specified location will be displayed below the form.

## API Key

Before running the project, make sure to set up your API key for the weather API provider. Follow the instructions in the **Installation** section to configure the API key as an environment variable.
